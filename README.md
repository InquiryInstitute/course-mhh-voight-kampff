**Season 1: Voight-Kampff — Technical spine, construction, examination**

---

> *"The Voight-Kampff test. It's designed to provoke an emotional response."*

---

## Purpose

Season 1 is the **technical core**. Students study existing detection systems, implement simplified versions, and face their first formal maieutic examination.

## Characteristics

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Duration | 14 weeks (February – May 2026) |
| Enrollment | Application required, cohort-based |
| Assessment | Pass / Revise / Refuse |
| Credential | Badge: Voight-Kampff Engineer |

## Technical Spine

### Systems Studied

- CAPTCHA variants (reCAPTCHA v2/v3, hCaptcha, Turnstile)
- Liveness detection (depth, motion, eye-tracking)
- Stylometry (keystroke dynamics, writing fingerprints)
- Behavioral biometrics (mouse movement, touch patterns)
- AI-generated content detection (GPTZero, Originality.ai, etc.)

### Systems Implemented

| Project | Timeline |
|---------|----------|
| A basic CAPTCHA system | Weeks 2–4 |
| A behavioral fingerprinting module | Weeks 5–7 |
| A prompt-based humanity test | Weeks 8–10 |
| A Voight-Kampff-inspired dialogue system | Weeks 11–13 |

## Programming Framework

- **Language**: Python (primary), JavaScript (secondary)
- **Tooling**: GitHub Classroom for code submission & peer review
- **Philosophy**: All code is inquiry-driven — implementations are vehicles for questions, not products.

## Maieutic Examination

At season's end, each student faces a one-on-one oral examination with a faculty agent. This is not a test of knowledge, but a test of *thinking under inquiry*.
