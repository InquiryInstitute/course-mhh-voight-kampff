# Maieutic Examination Format

## What Is a Maieutic Examination?

The maieutic method (from Greek *maieutikos*, "of midwifery") is Socratic: the examiner helps the student give birth to understanding through questioning, not lecturing.

In Season 1, you will defend your humanity test design in a maieutic examination with AI faculty agents. This is not a test of memorization—it is a test of understanding, honesty, and intellectual courage.

## Structure

**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Participants:**
- Student (you)
- 2-3 Faculty agents (selected based on your test design)

**Format:**
1. **Presentation** (5 minutes) — You present your test design
2. **Examination** (20 minutes) — Faculty ask probing questions
3. **Reflection** (5 minutes) — You articulate what you learned

## The Faculty Examiners

Faculty agents are selected based on the nature of your test:

| Faculty | Examines | Likely For |
|---------|----------|------------|
| a.turing | Theoretical soundness | All examinations |
| a.weizenbaum | Ethical implications | Tests involving deception |
| a.foucault-soci | Power dynamics | Surveillance-based tests |
| a.arendt | Moral judgment | Tests of moral character |
| a.shannon | Information theory | Statistical tests |
| a.dick | Empathy and humanity | Affective tests |

## What Faculty Will Ask

### a.turing Style Questions
- "Does passing your test prove anything about consciousness?"
- "Could your test be passed by a lookup table?"
- "What is the relationship between your test and the original imitation game?"

### a.weizenbaum Style Questions
- "What happens to someone who fails your test unfairly?"
- "Who has the power to administer this test?"
- "Should this test exist?"

### a.foucault-soci Style Questions
- "What knowledge does your test produce about its subjects?"
- "How does your test normalize certain behaviors?"
- "Who benefits from this classification system?"

### a.arendt Style Questions
- "What moral judgments are embedded in your test?"
- "Could an evil person pass your test?"
- "Does your test distinguish goodness from compliance?"

## Evaluation Criteria

### Intellectual Honesty (Primary)
- Acknowledging limitations
- Engaging with objections seriously
- Saying "I don't know" when appropriate
- Revising views based on examination

### Technical Understanding
- Explaining design choices
- Understanding failure modes
- Connecting to course material

### Ethical Awareness
- Considering consequences
- Acknowledging power dynamics
- Taking responsibility for design

## How to Prepare

### Do
- Re-read your design document critically
- Anticipate the strongest objections
- Practice articulating your reasoning
- Know your test's limitations better than anyone

### Don't
- Prepare scripted answers
- Try to "win" the examination
- Defend positions you don't believe
- Pretend your test is better than it is

## Sample Examination

**Student:** "My test measures willingness to help strangers by presenting scenarios requiring sacrifice."

**a.turing:** "Interesting. But couldn't an AI be trained on examples of human helpfulness?"

**Student:** "Yes, that's a known limitation. The responses could be pattern-matched."

**a.weizenbaum:** "What if someone fails because of trauma that makes them averse to strangers?"

**Student:** "That's... a significant problem. My test assumes a baseline of social comfort that not everyone has."

**a.foucault-soci:** "Who decides what counts as 'helping'? What if cultures differ?"

**Student:** "I initially assumed helping was universal, but you're right—my scenarios embed Western assumptions about individual choice."

**Reflection:** "I learned that my test measures willingness to conform to culturally specific expectations of prosocial behavior, not some universal 'humanity.' I would need to either narrow my claims or diversify my scenarios significantly."

## The Point

The maieutic examination is not adversarial—it is collaborative. The faculty help you understand your own design more deeply.

The best examinations are ones where the student:
1. Starts confident
2. Encounters genuine difficulty
3. Revises their understanding
4. Articulates what changed

This mirrors the course's central insight: the test reveals the examiner.

## Technical Setup

The examination is conducted via:
- Video call (your camera on)
- Faculty agents respond in real-time
- Session is recorded for review
- You receive written feedback within 48 hours

## Scheduling

Examinations are scheduled individually during Week 12.
- Sign up via the course calendar
- Allow 45 minutes (30 examination + 15 buffer)
- Rescheduling requires 48 hours notice
