# Welcome to Voight-Kampff (Season 1)

## What This Season Is

Voight-Kampff is a **12-week cohort-based technical season**. You will move from reading to building, from questions to specifications, from critique to construction.

This is Season 1: where theory becomes implementation.

## Prerequisites

- **Season 0 (Electric Sheep)**: Completion required
- **Programming**: Python proficiency expected
- **Mathematics**: Basic statistics, linear algebra helpful

## What You'll Do

1. **Study** existing humanity detection systems
2. **Implement** components of these systems from scratch
3. **Analyze** the assumptions embedded in their design
4. **Design** your own humanity test
5. **Defend** your design in a maieutic examination

## The Technical Spine

Over 12 weeks, you will study and implement:

| Week | System | Implementation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1-2 | The Turing Test | Conversation evaluation classifier |
| 3-4 | ELIZA/PARRY | Rule-based dialogue systems |
| 5-6 | Empathy Measures | Affective computing metrics |
| 7-8 | Behavioral Biometrics | Keystroke dynamics, mouse patterns |
| 9-10 | LLM Detection | Statistical and semantic analysis |
| 11-12 | Your Test | Original humanity test design |

## Core Texts

- *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?* — Philip K. Dick (review)
- *Computer Power and Human Reason* — Joseph Weizenbaum
- *Computing Machinery and Intelligence* — Alan Turing
- Selected papers on affective computing, biometrics, AI detection

## Assessment

### Continuous Assessment (60%)
- Weekly implementation assignments
- Code reviews and peer feedback
- Technical documentation

### Maieutic Examination (40%)
- Design defense with faculty agents
- Oral examination on design choices
- Critical reflection on limitations

## Tools & Environment

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Frameworks**: scikit-learn, transformers, spaCy
- **Platform**: GitHub Classroom for submissions
- **Discussion**: Matrix room for cohort

## Weekly Rhythm

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Monday | New module release, reading assignment |
| Wednesday | Live technical session (recorded) |
| Friday | Assignment due, peer review begins |
| Sunday | Peer review feedback due |

## The Central Question

> *Can you build a test that you yourself could not pass?*

Every system you implement will teach you something about what it means to be human—or what it means to claim to measure humanity.
