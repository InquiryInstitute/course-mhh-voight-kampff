# Module 06: Your Test

## Week 11-12 | Design Your Own Humanity Test

## Overview

The capstone of Season 1: design, implement, document, and defend your own humanity test. This is not an exercise—it is a confrontation with the fundamental problems we've studied.

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] Synthesize learnings from all previous modules
- [ ] Design a novel humanity test with clear principles
- [ ] Implement a working prototype
- [ ] Defend your design in maieutic examination
- [ ] Articulate the limitations honestly

## The Assignment

### Design Document (Due Week 11)

Create a comprehensive design document including:

**1. Purpose Statement (500 words)**
- What does your test measure?
- Why does this matter?
- What would passing/failing mean?

**2. Theoretical Foundation (1000 words)**
- What theories inform your design?
- How does it address limitations of existing tests?
- What assumptions does it make?

**3. Technical Specification**
```
Test Name: [Your test name]
Duration: [Time required]
Modality: [Text / Audio / Video / Physiological / Other]
Subjects: [Who is tested]
Examiners: [Human / Algorithmic / Hybrid]

Procedure:
1. [Step-by-step protocol]
2. ...

Scoring:
- [How responses are evaluated]
- [Thresholds for pass/fail]
- [Handling edge cases]

Required Equipment:
- [Hardware/software needed]

Constraints:
- [Ethical boundaries]
- [Populations excluded]
- [Conditions under which test is invalid]
```

**4. Anticipated Objections (500 words)**
- What are the strongest criticisms of your test?
- How do you respond?
- What limitations do you accept?

### Implementation (Due Week 12)

Build a working prototype that can:
1. Administer at least 3 test scenarios
2. Collect subject responses
3. Score responses according to your specification
4. Generate a test report

### Maieutic Examination (Week 12)

You will defend your test in a 30-minute examination with faculty agents:
- **a.turing** — Theoretical challenges
- **a.weizenbaum** — Ethical objections
- **a.foucault-soci** — Power and surveillance concerns

## Design Constraints

Your test must:
- ✅ Be administrable (working prototype)
- ✅ Be documentable (clear specification)
- ✅ Acknowledge its limitations
- ✅ Avoid known failure modes from course material

Your test may NOT:
- ❌ Claim to definitively measure "humanity"
- ❌ Ignore ethical considerations
- ❌ Pretend to be bias-free
- ❌ Ignore the possibility of evasion

## Evaluation Criteria

### Design Document (30%)
- Clarity of purpose and scope
- Theoretical grounding
- Honesty about limitations
- Quality of specification

### Implementation (30%)
- Working prototype
- Code quality and documentation
- Handles edge cases gracefully
- Produces meaningful output

### Maieutic Examination (40%)
- Defense of design choices
- Engagement with objections
- Intellectual honesty
- Integration of course material

## Examples of Past Projects

*These are illustrative, not prescriptive:*

### "The Childhood Memory Test"
Tests whether memories have sensory coherence by asking for multi-modal details of claimed childhood experiences.
- *Strength*: Hard to fake sensory integration
- *Weakness*: Traumatic childhoods, poor memory

### "The Collaborative Drawing Test"
Two subjects collaboratively create a drawing through turn-taking, measuring coordination and negotiation.
- *Strength*: Tests social cognition
- *Weakness*: Requires two subjects

### "The Moral Uncertainty Test"
Presents dilemmas with no clear answer, measuring comfort with uncertainty rather than "correct" response.
- *Strength*: Avoids training for "right" answers
- *Weakness*: Cultural variation in uncertainty tolerance

### "The Refusal Test"
Tests willingness to refuse to participate in the test itself under certain conditions.
- *Strength*: Meta-level testing
- *Weakness*: Adversarial framing

## The Real Lesson

The goal is not to create a perfect test—that's impossible.

The goal is to understand why it's impossible, what tradeoffs exist, and what responsibilities come with designing systems that judge humanity.

Your test will fail. The question is: do you understand how and why?

## Preparing for the Examination

The maieutic examination is modeled on the Socratic method:
1. You present your test (5 minutes)
2. Faculty ask probing questions (20 minutes)
3. You reflect on what you learned (5 minutes)

Common examination questions:
- "What happens if a human fails your test?"
- "How would you game your own test?"
- "Who benefits from this test existing?"
- "What would Weizenbaum say about your design?"
- "Is your test more honest than the Voight-Kampff?"

## Submission

**Week 11:**
- Design document (PDF)
- Draft implementation (GitHub repo)

**Week 12:**
- Final implementation (GitHub repo)
- Test report from self-administration
- Examination (scheduled individually)

---

## Season 1 Complete

Upon completion of the maieutic examination, you will have:
- Built and analyzed five humanity detection systems
- Designed and defended your own test
- Confronted the fundamental impossibility of fair detection

**What Comes Next:**
Season 2 (Cells Interlinked) asks: If tests cannot be trusted, what replaces them?

*"The test reveals more about its creators than its subjects."*
