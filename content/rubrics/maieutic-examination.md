# Maieutic Examination Rubric

*Season 1: Voight-Kampff*

---

## Overview

The maieutic examination is a 45-minute oral defense conducted with a faculty agent. It is not a test of knowledge recall. It is a test of **thinking under inquiry**.

The term "maieutic" comes from Socrates' method of intellectual midwifery — helping ideas be born through questioning.

## Sample Exchange

**Faculty (a.turing):** Your test relies heavily on response latency. What happens if someone is simply a slow typist?

**Pass-level response:**
> "That's a real limitation. I tried to calibrate for baseline typing speed in the setup phase, but you're right that it's imperfect. Someone with motor difficulties would be disadvantaged. I'm not sure how to solve this without introducing a whole separate calibration process, which creates its own problems. Maybe... the test shouldn't rely on timing at all? But then I lose my main signal. It's a trade-off I haven't resolved."

**Revise-level response:**
> "I accounted for that with the calibration phase."

**Fail-level response:**
> "Slow typists aren't really the target of this test."

## Preparation Guidance

### Before the Examination

1. **Review your test design** — Know your rationale cold
2. **Anticipate challenges** — What are the weak points?
3. **Revisit key readings** — Not to memorize, but to refresh
4. **Practice articulating ideas aloud** — It's different from writing

### During the Examination

1. **Take your time** — Pause before responding
2. **Ask for clarification** — If you don't understand a question
3. **Think aloud** — Let us see your reasoning
4. **Admit uncertainty** — "I don't know" is better than bluffing

### Technical Setup

- Stable internet connection
- Camera on, good lighting
- Quiet space
- Test your setup beforehand

1. Written feedback provided within 48 hours
2. 2-week revision period
3. Additional readings or reflection assigned
4. Abbreviated re-examination (30 min)

### Refuse
The candidate may be refused credentials if:

## The Observer Role

A human observer is present during all examinations. They:
- Do not participate in questioning
- Ensure fair treatment
- Can pause examination for technical issues
- Provide oversight of the faculty agent

If you have concerns during the examination, you may address the observer.

## A Note on Anxiety

Many students find oral examinations stressful. This is normal.

Remember:
- This is a conversation, not an interrogation
- You are not expected to have all the answers
- The faculty is interested in your thinking, not your performance
- You have already done the hard work — this is a chance to share it

If examination anxiety is a significant barrier, contact us to discuss alternatives.

## The Question Beneath the Question

Every question in the maieutic examination is really asking:

*Have you allowed this material to work on you?*

We can tell the difference between someone who completed assignments and someone who let the questions change them. We're looking for the latter.

You don't need to be transformed. You need to be honest about where you are.
