# Written Assignment Rubric

*Season 1: Voight-Kampff*

---

## Overview

Written assignments (analyses, reflections, position papers) are evaluated on four dimensions: **Argument**, **Evidence**, **Engagement**, and **Clarity**.

This is not an English composition course. Clear thinking is valued over polished prose.

---

## Scoring

| Dimension | Pass | Revise | Fail |
|-----------|------|--------|------|
| Argument | Clear thesis, logical structure | Thesis unclear or structure weak | No discernible argument |
| Evidence | Supports claims with specifics | Some unsupported claims | Assertions without support |
| Engagement | Genuine wrestling with ideas | Surface treatment | Dismissive or mechanical |
| Clarity | Understandable, organized | Some confusion, fixable | Incomprehensible |

**Overall:**
- **Pass:** Pass in all 4 dimensions, OR Pass in 3 + Revise in 1
- **Revise:** Pass in 2 + Revise in 2
- **Fail:** Fail in any dimension

---

## Dimension Details

### 1. Argument (30%)

**Pass:**
- Clear thesis or central claim
- Logical structure that builds the argument
- Acknowledges counterarguments or limitations
- Conclusion follows from the argument

**Revise:**
- Thesis is vague or buried
- Structure is confusing
- Ignores obvious counterarguments
- Conclusion doesn't connect to argument

**Fail:**
- No thesis or claim
- Random collection of thoughts
- Contradicts itself without acknowledgment
- No conclusion

**What we're looking for:**

A thesis is a claim that someone could disagree with. "The Turing Test measures intelligence" is not a thesis. "The Turing Test fails to measure intelligence because it conflates performance with understanding" is a thesis.

---

### 2. Evidence (25%)

**Pass:**
- Claims are supported by specific examples
- References readings and course materials
- Uses data or case studies where appropriate
- Distinguishes between fact and interpretation

**Revise:**
- Some claims unsupported
- Vague references ("studies show...")
- Over-reliance on one source
- Mixes fact and opinion without clarity

**Fail:**
- Assertions without any support
- Misrepresents sources
- Fabricates evidence
- Ignores assigned readings entirely

**Types of acceptable evidence:**
- Quotes or paraphrases from readings (cited)
- Examples from course materials
- Real-world cases (documented)
- Personal experience (when relevant and acknowledged as such)
- Data or statistics (sourced)

---

### 3. Engagement (25%)

**Pass:**
- Genuine intellectual wrestling with the topic
- Asks interesting questions
- Makes unexpected connections
- Shows that ideas matter to the writer
- Willing to sit with uncertainty

**Revise:**
- Treats assignment as box-checking
- Superficial treatment of complex ideas
- Avoids difficult questions
- Generic observations anyone could make

**Fail:**
- Dismissive of the topic
- No evidence of thinking
- Copy-paste from summaries
- AI-generated without human thought

**Examples:**

Pass-level engagement:
> "Weizenbaum's horror at ELIZA's reception made me uncomfortable, because I found myself wanting to dismiss his concerns. Why? Maybe because admitting he's right means admitting something uncomfortable about my own interactions with AI..."

Revise-level engagement:
> "Weizenbaum thought ELIZA was dangerous because people anthropomorphized it."

---

### 4. Clarity (20%)

**Pass:**
- Writing is clear and understandable
- Organized into coherent paragraphs
- Transitions between ideas
- Appropriate length (not padded, not truncated)
- Grammar/spelling don't impede understanding

**Revise:**
- Some confusing passages
- Organization could be clearer
- Transitions abrupt
- Noticeably over or under length
- Some distracting errors

**Fail:**
- Cannot understand what the writer means
- No paragraph structure
- Completely inappropriate length
- Errors make reading impossible

**Note:** We're not grading grammar. We're assessing whether your ideas come through. ESL writers are not penalized for imperfect English as long as meaning is clear.

---

## Formatting Requirements

### Standard Format
- Word count as specified (±10%)
- 12pt readable font
- Standard margins
- Page numbers (for longer pieces)
- Your name and assignment title

### Citations
- Any citation style is acceptable (APA, MLA, Chicago)
- Be consistent
- Cite all sources, including AI assistance
- Include page numbers for direct quotes

### Submission
- PDF or Markdown preferred
- .doc/.docx acceptable
- Submit via GitHub Classroom

---

## AI Assistance Policy

### You MAY:
- Use AI for brainstorming or outlining
- Ask AI to explain concepts from readings
- Use AI to check grammar/clarity
- Use AI to find sources (verify them yourself)

### You MUST:
- Write your own argument and analysis
- Document any substantial AI assistance
- Be able to discuss your paper in office hours

### You MAY NOT:
- Have AI write your paper
- Submit AI-generated text as your own
- Use AI to summarize readings you didn't read

### How to Document AI Assistance

Add a note at the end:
> "AI Assistance: I used ChatGPT to brainstorm counterarguments to my thesis and to check grammar. The argument and analysis are my own."

---

## The Revise Process

1. Specific feedback provided within 1 week
2. 1 week to resubmit revised version
3. Revise addresses specific feedback
4. Can achieve Pass (not higher)
5. Second Revise = Fail

---

## Word Count Guidelines

Word counts are targets, not limits:
- **±10%** is fine
- Going significantly under suggests incomplete thinking
- Going significantly over suggests inability to edit

If you genuinely need more space, explain why in a note.

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Leads to Revise:
- Summarizing readings instead of analyzing them
- Making claims without support
- Ignoring the prompt
- Generic conclusions ("In conclusion, this is a complex topic")

### Leads to Fail:
- AI-generated papers
- Plagiarism
- Not addressing the prompt at all
- Submitting nothing

---

## A Note on "Right Answers"

Most written assignments in this course don't have right answers. We're not looking for you to agree with us or the readings. We're looking for:

- Evidence that you've done the reading
- A clear argument (even one we disagree with)
- Honest engagement with difficulty
- Willingness to think

You can Pass with an argument we think is wrong, if it's well-constructed and supported.

You can Fail with an argument we agree with, if it's poorly constructed and unsupported.

## Questions?

Ask in Matrix or office hours. We'd rather clarify expectations before you submit than evaluate a misunderstanding after.
